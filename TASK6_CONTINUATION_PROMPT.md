  3f0f9859-2336-4871-aca4-397d1b69d93f (Task 6 - Diff Engine
  Implementation)Status: DOING (Implementation 60% complete,
  needs completion & testing)

  CURRENT PROGRESS

  ✅ COMPLETED WORK

  1. ✅ Research Phase Complete
    - Analyzed existing types from pdf-processor.ts and
  embeddings.ts
    - Verified diff library and @types/diff are already installed
    - Studied DocumentComparison and DocumentDiff interfaces from    
   analysis.ts
  2. ✅ Architecture Design Complete
    - Designed LegalDocumentComparator class with streaming
  progress
    - Created ComparisonOptions interface for Indonesian legal       
  documents
    - Defined LEGAL_CLAUSE_HIERARCHY for significance scoring        
    - Planned semantic similarity integration with embeddings        
  3. 🟡 Implementation 60% Started
    - Started replacing existing diff-engine.ts with
  comprehensive implementation
    - Built core class structure and interfaces
    - Implemented text preprocessing and normalization methods       
    - Created semantic mapping and confidence calculation methods    

  REMAINING WORK (40%)

  🔧 Critical Implementation Tasks

  1. IMMEDIATE: Complete diff-engine.ts implementation
    - Finish replacing the existing partial implementation
    - Add all remaining helper methods (significance scoring,        
  context generation, etc.)
    - Complete the convenience functions (compareDocuments,
  quickCompare, detailedCompare)
    - Ensure proper integration with existing types from
  analysis.ts
  2. TESTING: Comprehensive test suite
    - Create diff-engine.test.ts with full coverage
    - Test legal-aware clause mapping and significance scoring       
    - Test semantic similarity integration with embeddings
    - Test progress callback functionality
    - Test Indonesian legal document structure handling
  3. INTEGRATION: Validate with existing pipeline
    - Test integration with ClauseSegment from pdf-processor.ts      
    - Verify DocumentComparison output matches analysis.ts types     
    - Test with real Indonesian legal document clause samples        
    - Validate performance with large document comparisons

  KEY IMPLEMENTATION HIGHLIGHTS COMPLETED

  Semantic-Aware Mapping System

  // Combines embeddings + text similarity for accurate clause       
  matching
  const combinedSimilarity = (semanticSimilarity * 0.7) +
  (textSimilarity * 0.3);
  const mappingConfidence = this.calculateMappingConfidence(/*       
  multiple factors */);

  Indonesian Legal Significance Scoring

  const LEGAL_CLAUSE_HIERARCHY = {
    'pasal': 5,      // Articles - highest legal significance        
    'bab': 5,        // Chapters - structural importance
    'ayat': 4,       // Verses - high significance
    'bagian': 4,     // Sections - organizational importance
    // ... etc
  };

  Progress-Aware Processing

  this.updateProgress({
    current_phase: 'analyzing',
    processed_clauses: completed,
    total_clauses: totalClauses,
    estimated_remaining_ms: timeEstimate
  });

  FILES STATUS

  - ✅ app/types/analysis.ts - Already has complete
  DocumentComparison & DocumentDiff types
  - 🟡 app/lib/diff-engine.ts - 60% implemented, needs completion    
  - ❌ app/lib/tests/diff-engine.test.ts - Needs creation
  - ✅ app/lib/embeddings.ts - Complete, provides semantic
  similarity functions
  - ✅ app/lib/pdf-processor.ts - Complete, provides
  ClauseSegment interface

  CONTINUATION COMMANDS

  # To continue this work:
  1. Complete the diff-engine.ts implementation (remaining 40%)      
  2. Create comprehensive test suite with Indonesian legal doc       
  examples
  3. Test integration with pdf-processor ClauseSegment output        
  4. Validate semantic similarity performance with embeddings        
  5. Mark Task 6 complete and proceed to Task 7 (RAG retriever)      

  # Archon Commands:
  # After completion:
  mcp__archon__update_task(task_id="3f0f9859-2336-4871-aca4-397d1    
  b69d93f", status="done")

  TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS

  Core Features to Complete:

  - ✅ Legal clause hierarchy significance scoring
  - ✅ Semantic similarity with embeddings integration
  - ✅ Indonesian legal document structure awareness
  - 🟡 Progress tracking with streaming callbacks (60% done)
  - ❌ Comprehensive text diff explanations with legal
  implications
  - ❌ Move detection for repositioned clauses
  - ❌ Batch processing for large document pairs

  Performance Targets:

  - Handle 50+ page legal documents within 3-minute processing       
  time
  - Semantic analysis accuracy >85% for similar clause matching      
  - Memory efficient processing with configurable batch sizes        
  - Graceful degradation when embeddings API is unavailable

  CRITICAL NOTES

  - Dependencies: diff library already installed, embeddings.ts      
  ready for integration
  - Types: DocumentComparison interface from analysis.ts must be     
  followed exactly
  - Legal Context: Indonesian legal document structure (Pasal,       
  Ayat, Huruf) is core requirement
  - Performance: Semantic analysis is optional but significantly     
  improves accuracy
  - Testing: Must test with actual Indonesian legal document
  clause examples

  Task 6 is 60% complete - needs implementation completion, 
  testing, and integration validation before proceeding to Task 7    
   (RAG retriever for conflict detection).

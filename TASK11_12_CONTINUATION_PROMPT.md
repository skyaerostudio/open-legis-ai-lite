# Task 11-12 Continuation Prompt for Open-LegisAI Lite

## Context
This is a continuation of the Open-LegisAI Lite implementation. Tasks 1-10 have been completed, implementing the core backend infrastructure, processing pipeline, database schema, and comprehensive results UI components.

**Current Status:**
- âœ… Tasks 1-10: Backend infrastructure, upload routes, processing pipeline, and results UI components complete
- ðŸŽ¯ Next: Custom React hooks for state management and dynamic public sharing pages (Tasks 11-12)

## Critical Instructions - READ FIRST

### ARCHON-FIRST RULE
BEFORE doing ANYTHING else:
1. Check Archon MCP server availability with `mcp__archon__list_tasks`
2. Find and get the next TODO task with `mcp__archon__get_task`
3. Mark task as "doing" before starting work
4. Use Archon task management as PRIMARY system throughout

### Project Context

## Development Workflow

### 1. Start with Archon Task Management:
```bash
# Get current tasks
mcp__archon__list_tasks(filter_by="status", filter_value="todo", project_id="55415c53-b616-4d68-9cf0-3d51200e93e7")

# Start Task 11
mcp__archon__get_task(task_id="[task_11_id]")
mcp__archon__update_task(task_id="[task_11_id]", status="doing")
```

### 2. Research Phase (for each task):
```bash
# Research hook patterns and real-time integration
mcp__archon__perform_rag_query(query="React hooks real-time subscriptions cleanup", match_count=5)
mcp__archon__search_code_examples(query="Next.js dynamic routes SEO optimization", match_count=3)
```

### 3. Implementation Standards:
- Follow existing code conventions in the project
- Use TypeScript with strict type checking
- Import types from `@/types/` directory
- Use existing UI components from Task 10
- Add comprehensive error handling
- Write accessible HTML with proper ARIA labels
- Implement proper cleanup in React hooks

### 4. Integration Points to Verify:

**Existing Files to Study:**
- `app/hooks/useUploadWithProgress.ts` - Current upload hook
- `app/hooks/useProcessingStatus.ts` - Current processing hook
- `app/lib/supabase-realtime.ts` - Real-time client configuration
- `app/components/results/` - All components from Task 10
- `supabase/migrations/20250904000001_fix_processing_pipeline.sql` - Database schema
- `app/types/processing.ts` - Service job types and configurations

**API Endpoints to Integrate:**
- `GET /api/results/[id]` - Fetch job results
- `POST /api/share` - Create public share links
- `GET /api/shared/[id]` - Fetch public share data
- `POST /api/export` - Export functionality

### 5. Quality Assurance:
- Run `npm run lint` after each hook/component
- Test hooks with different service types and error scenarios
- Verify real-time updates work correctly
- Test public sharing functionality thoroughly
- Validate SEO meta tags with social media debuggers
- Test print layouts in different browsers
- Verify accessibility with screen readers
- Test keyboard navigation throughout

#### Browser Testing with Playwright MCP:
Use the Playwright MCP server for comprehensive testing:

```bash
# Test real-time hook updates
mcp__playwright__browser_navigate(url="http://localhost:3000/results/[job-id]")
mcp__playwright__browser_wait_for(text="Processing completed")
mcp__playwright__browser_take_screenshot(filename="results-realtime-test.png")

# Test public sharing workflow
mcp__playwright__browser_click(element="Share button", ref="btn-share")
mcp__playwright__browser_wait_for(text="Share link created")
mcp__playwright__browser_evaluate(function="() => navigator.clipboard.readText()")

# Navigate to public sharing page and verify SEO
PUBLIC_URL="[shared link]"
mcp__playwright__browser_navigate(url=PUBLIC_URL)
mcp__playwright__browser_evaluate(function="() => ({
  title: document.title,
  ogTitle: document.querySelector('meta[property=\"og:title\"]')?.content,
  ogImage: document.querySelector('meta[property=\"og:image\"]')?.content
})")

# Test print layout
mcp__playwright__browser_take_screenshot(filename="print-layout-test.png", fullPage=true)
```

### 6. Task Completion:
```bash
# Mark task as review when complete
mcp__archon__update_task(task_id="[task_id]", status="review")

# Get next task
mcp__archon__list_tasks(filter_by="status", filter_value="todo")
```

## Next Steps After Completion

After Tasks 11-12 are complete, the Open-LegisAI Lite MVP will be ready for:
1. **Final integration testing** across all services using Playwright MCP
2. **Performance optimization** and caching strategy implementation
3. **Production deployment** with comprehensive monitoring
4. **User acceptance testing** with real legal documents
5. **SEO and social media optimization** validation

**Remember**: Always use Archon task management first, research before implementing, use Playwright MCP for comprehensive browser testing, and maintain high code quality standards throughout. The success of this implementation depends on seamless integration with the existing codebase from Tasks 1-10.
